# EventCreateService - Technical and Functional Analysis

## 1. Overview
The `EventCreateService` is responsible for creating new events. It validates and transforms input data, then persists the event through the repository.

## 2. Input DTO
- **DTO class used:** `EventCreateDTO`
- **Validation rules:**  
  Includes validation for fields such as `name`, `description`, `from_date`, `to_date`, and `available_seats`.
- **Transformation:**  
  Raw input parameters are transformed and validated via the `EventCreateDTOAssembler`.

## 3. Output DTO
- **DTO class used:** None (service returns inserted event ID as `int`).
- **Transformation:**  
  The repository’s `insert` method returns the newly created event ID.

## 4. Dependencies
- **EventCreateDTOAssembler:** Validates and converts raw input data to a typed DTO.
- **EventRepository:** Responsible for inserting the event into the data store.

## 5. Database Interactions
- **Write operations:**  
  - `insert(EventCreateDTO $dto)` persists the new event.
- **Read operations:**  
  - None.
- **Transaction management:**  
  - No explicit transaction control inside the service. Assumed handled internally by repository or DB layer.

## 6. Business Logic Flow
1. Transform and validate input parameters into an `EventCreateDTO`.
2. Pass the DTO to the `EventRepository` for persistence.
3. Return the inserted event’s ID.

## 7. Exception Handling and Anomalies
- Input validation errors are thrown by the assembler before database interaction.
- Repository failures (e.g., DB connectivity, constraint violations) are expected to propagate exceptions upwards.
- No internal retry or rollback logic present at service level.

## 8. Variables and Data Flow
- **Input params:** Array with event details such as name, description, dates, and seats.
- **DTO internal state:** Strongly typed event data.
- **Return value:** Integer event ID generated upon insertion.

## 9. Summary and Recommendations
- Service is focused and minimal, correctly separating validation and persistence.
- Could benefit from transaction control if creation requires multiple dependent operations in future.
- Consider validating date ranges (e.g., `from_date` before `to_date`) at DTO or service level if not already done.
