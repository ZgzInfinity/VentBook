# BookingCreateService - Technical and Functional Analysis

## 1. Overview
The `BookingCreateService` manages the business logic related to creating new bookings for events. It validates input data, checks event availability, prevents duplicate bookings by the same user on the same date, and updates the event's available seats atomically.

## 2. Input DTO
- **DTO class used:** `BookingCreateDTO`
- **Validation rules:**  
  The DTO validates fields such as `reference`, `event_id`, `event_date`, `attendees`, and `identification`.
- **Transformation:**  
  Raw input parameters are transformed and validated through the `BookingCreateDTOAssembler` into a typed DTO.

## 3. Dependencies
- **BookingRepository:** Responsible for saving new bookings and querying existing bookings by buyer ID and date.
- **EventRepository:** Handles querying events by ID and updating available seats after booking creation.
- **BookingCreateDTOAssembler:** Transforms raw input into a validated DTO.

## 4. Database Interactions
- **Read operations:**  
  - `findById(eventId)` to retrieve the event details.
  - `findByBuyerIdAndDate(eventDate, identification)` to check if the user already has a booking on the given date.
- **Write operations:**  
  - `save()` to insert the new booking.
  - `updateAvailableSeats(eventId, requestedSeats)` to decrement available seats in the event.
- **Transaction management:**  
  - Transaction begins with `beginTransaction()`.
  - Commits with `commit()` after successful booking and seat update.
  - Rolls back on exceptions with `rollBack()` ensuring atomicity.

## 5. Business Logic Flow
1. Transform input parameters into `BookingCreateDTO`.
2. Retrieve event by ID; if not found, throw `InvalidArgumentException`.
3. Verify booking date is within the event's date range; otherwise, throw `InvalidArgumentException`.
4. Check if user already has a booking on the same date; if yes, throw `InvalidArgumentException`.
5. Check if requested seats are available; if not, throw `InvalidArgumentException`.
6. Begin transaction.
7. Save new booking data.
8. Update event's available seats by subtracting the requested number.
9. Commit transaction.
10. On any exception, rollback and propagate error.

## 6. Exception Handling and Anomalies
- **InvalidArgumentException:**  
  - When event ID does not exist.
  - When booking date is out of event date range.
  - When the user already has a booking on the same date.
  - When requested seats exceed available seats.
- **General exceptions:**  
  Any error during DB save or seat update leads to transaction rollback.
- **Potential anomalies:**  
  - Race conditions in concurrent seat updates, mitigated at DB or app level.
  - Data inconsistency if commit fails after partial writes.

## 7. Variables and Data Flow
- **Input params:** Array containing booking info such as reference, event ID, event date, attendees count, and buyer identification.
- **DTO internal state:** Contains validated booking data.
- **Local variables:**  
  - `$event`: Event record fetched from DB.
  - `$eventFrom`, `$eventTo`: Event date range.
  - `$bookingDate`: Formatted booking date.
  - `$existingBooking`: Existing booking if found for the same user and date.
  - `$availableSeats`: Current available seats in event.
  - `$requestedSeats`: Seats requested in booking.

## 8. Summary and Recommendations
- The service enforces strong business rules preventing invalid bookings and ensuring seat availability.
- Transactional approach ensures atomic creation and seat update.
- Consider adding database-level locking or optimistic concurrency for seat updates.
- Adding logging on exceptions and key actions would improve observability.
- Early validation in the assembler avoids unnecessary DB queries.
