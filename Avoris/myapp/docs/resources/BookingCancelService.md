# BookingCancelService - Technical and Functional Analysis

## 1. Overview
The `BookingCancelService` is responsible for managing the cancellation of a user's booking. It handles the validation, transactional deletion of the booking record, and updating the available seats for the associated event.

## 2. Input DTO
- **DTO class used:** `BookingCancelDTO`
- **Validation rules:**  
  The DTO validates the booking ID ensuring it is present and correctly formatted.
- **Transformation:**  
  Input parameters are transformed into the DTO using `BookingCancelDTOAssembler` which validates and structures the input.

## 3. Dependencies
- **BookingRepository:** Handles CRUD operations related to bookings, including fetching by ID and deleting a booking.
- **EventRepository:** Manages event-related data, particularly updating available seats after a booking cancellation.
- **BookingCancelDTOAssembler:** Transforms and validates raw input parameters into a typed DTO object.

## 4. Database Interactions
- **Read operation:**  
  `findById(bookingId)` retrieves the booking record, fetching critical data such as `attendees` count and the associated `event_id`.
- **Write operations:**  
  - `deleteById(bookingId)` deletes the booking record from the database.
  - `updateAvailableSeats(eventId, attendees, true)` increases the number of available seats on the event by the number of attendees from the cancelled booking.
- **Transaction management:**  
  - Begins with `beginTransaction()`
  - Commits using `commit()` after all operations succeed
  - Rolls back changes using `rollBack()` in case of any exception, ensuring atomicity.

## 5. Business Logic Flow
1. Transform raw input params to `BookingCancelDTO`.
2. Extract booking ID from DTO.
3. Begin database transaction.
4. Attempt to fetch booking record by ID.
5. If booking not found, throw `NotFoundHttpException`.
6. Retrieve `attendees` count and `event_id` from booking.
7. Delete booking record.  
   If deletion fails, throw `BadRequestHttpException`.
8. Update available seats for the event by increasing them by the number of cancelled attendees.
9. Commit the transaction.
10. If any error occurs, rollback and rethrow the exception.

## 6. Exception Handling and Anomalies
- **NotFoundHttpException:** Thrown if the booking with the specified ID does not exist.
- **BadRequestHttpException:** Thrown if the deletion of the booking record fails.
- **General exceptions:** Any other exception triggers rollback of the transaction to maintain data consistency.
- **Potential anomalies:**  
  - Concurrent updates to available seats might lead to race conditions if not handled at the DB level.
  - Deletion failure could be due to DB constraints or connectivity issues.

## 7. Variables and Data Flow
- **Input params:** Array containing at least `id` key for booking cancellation.
- **DTO internal state:** Contains validated booking ID.
- **Local variables:**  
  - `$bookingId`: Extracted from DTO, used to identify the booking.
  - `$booking`: Booking record fetched from DB.
  - `$attendees`: Number of attendees associated with the booking.
  - `$eventId`: Event ID tied to the booking.
  - `$success`: Boolean flag indicating success of delete operation.

## 8. Summary and Recommendations
- The service correctly ensures transactional integrity, atomic booking cancellation, and seat update.
- Consider adding database-level locking or optimistic concurrency controls to avoid race conditions on seat availability updates.
- Logging exceptions and actions may enhance monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Validate input earlier in the call stack to reduce unnecessary DB transactions.
